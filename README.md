# DeepLearn-FinalProject-Multi-Model Deep Learning Approach for Waste Classification and Plastic Type Identification
This project implements a multi-stage deep learning system for waste classification and detailed plastic type identification using transfer learning with EfficientNet. The system is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling real-time image-based waste classification.

Waste management requires accurate classification to improve recycling efficiency. This project addresses the problem by applying a two-stage classification approach:

1. General Waste Classification

Classifies waste into main categories such as organic, plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc.

2. Plastic Type Identification
   
Further identifies plastic waste into specific polymer types (e.g., PET, HDPE, PP).
